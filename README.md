# Decay Protocol

A minimal zombie survival game implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Move around the grid, battle zombies, rest to recover action points, and search areas for useful items.

Tiles may also have special attributes like traps or loot chests that change the risks and rewards of exploring. Some tiles are marked as zombie spawn zones where undead appear more frequently.

Zombies now come in several types with their own behaviors such as aggressive walkers, fast runners and armored brutes. Their stats influence how quickly they move and how many hits they take.

The inventory system tracks item weight and durability. Carrying capacity is limited, so choose what to take with you. Crafting recipes allow combining materials found while scavenging into useful gear.

## Expanded World Design

### Island Setting
The entire game now takes place on a quarantined island. The edges of the map are **ocean** tiles which are impassable. This creates a natural boundary and gives players a clear sense of confinement. Key locations such as a hospital, radio tower, docks and warehouses are scattered around the island to encourage exploration.

### Narrative and Backstory
Rumors tell of a failed experiment at the island's research facility that unleashed the virus. Survivors piece together information through notes and NPC dialogue to uncover how the outbreak began and whether a cure exists.

### Quest Objectives
Players can pursue longâ€‘term goals like restoring a boat at the docks or locating a scientist who knows how to create a vaccine. These objectives give structure to the sandbox gameplay and can be completed in any order.

### Safe Zones and Base Building
Certain areas can be fortified to become safe zones where zombies cannot spawn. Using scavenged materials, players can build barricades and craft workstations to improve their base over time.

### Companion NPCs
Friendly survivors with simple AI can be recruited. Companions help in combat and can be assigned to guard a base or gather supplies. Their stories add depth to the world and drive additional quests.
