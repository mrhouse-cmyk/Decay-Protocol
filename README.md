# Decay Protocol

A minimal zombie survival game implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Move around the grid, battle zombies, rest to recover action points, and search areas for useful items.

Tiles may also have special attributes like traps or loot chests that change the risks and rewards of exploring. Some tiles are marked as zombie spawn zones where undead appear more frequently.

Zombies now come in several types with their own behaviors such as aggressive walkers, fast runners and armored brutes. Their stats influence how quickly they move and how many hits they take.
